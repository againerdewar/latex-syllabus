\section*{Use of technology}
Calculators and other technology are \emph{not} allowed on the exams.
Accordingly, you should not become dependent on them.
Technological tools can be valuable for checking your answers on homework problems, but you must know how to do all the work yourself, and you must show it on the homework.

\section*{Collaboration}
Collaboration with your fellow mathematicians is an important skill.
Working together can help everyone in a group to get over creative and technical hurdles and lead to increased understanding.
Moreover, it provides valuable experience in communicating effectively.

I therefore encourage you to work on your homework in small groups.
However, it is essential that your work reflect your own understanding.
To demonstrate this, \emph{you must submit work that is entirely your own, with no text copied from or written together with another student}.

If you have any questions about this policy or how it applies to a particular situation, please see me about them \emph{before} submitting the work in question.
